🌀 Circular Singly Linked List in Python
This repository contains my implementation and practice exercises for Circular Singly Linked Lists (CSLL) in Python — built as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) learning journey.

I’ve coded out core methods like append, prepend, remove, pop, set, and more, along with problem-solving exercises to reinforce the concepts.

📚 What’s Inside:
✅ Full CSLL class with common methods

🧪 Practice exercises to test logic

🔁 Covers all basic and advanced CSLL operations

🧠 Clean, readable code with in-place comments for learning

🔧 Topics Covered:
Creating a circular singly linked list

Insertion (at head, tail, and by index)

Deletion (pop, pop_first, remove)

Updating (set) and accessing (get)

Breaking the circular reference (delete_all)

Edge case handling (empty list, one node, invalid index)

💡 Why Circular Linked Lists?
Unlike regular singly linked lists, circular lists don’t end — the tail connects back to the head, which enables cyclic traversal and efficient memory usage in certain systems (e.g., round-robin scheduling, buffer memory).
